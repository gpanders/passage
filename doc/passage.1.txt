NAME
----

passage - password store built on the age encryption protocol

SYNOPSIS
--------

*passage* [_COMMAND_] [_OPTIONS_] [_ARGS_]

DESCRIPTION
-----------

*passage* is a password store modeled after *pass*(1) that emphasizes speed and
eschews the use of PGP in favor of the age encryption protocol.

*passage* keeps your encrypted passwords under _$HOME/.passage_ and offers a
series of subcommands to add, remove, and display these passwords.

If no _COMMAND_ is specified, _COMMAND_ defaults to _show_ or _ls_, depending
on if any _ARGS_ are present. Otherwise, _COMMAND_ must be one of the commands
listed below.

COMMANDS
--------

*init* [_--recipient=recipient_, _-r recipient_]... [_--key=key-file_, _-k key-file_]::

Initialize a new password store, or reinitialize a store with the given
options. With no options, *passage* creates a new secret key if one does not
already exist at _$XDG_DATA_HOME/passage/key.txt_. The public key is written to
_$HOME/.passage/.public-keys_ along with any other public keys specified using
_--recipient_ or _-r_.
+
If an age secret key already exists at _key.txt_, *passage* can use the
existing key instead of generating a new one by using the _--key_ or _-k_
option. If _--key_ or _-k_ is used with *init* and a secret key already exists,
the password store will be reencrypted using the given key.

*ls*::

List the contents of the password store. This command is alternatively named
*list*.

*show* [_--clip_, _-c_] [_name_]::

With no arguments, display the contents of the password store (identical
to *ls*). Otherwise, decrypt and display the password for _name_ to
standard output.
+
With _--clip_ or _-c_, copy the decrypted password for _name_ to the
system clipboard instead of displaying it.

*insert* _name_::

Insert a new password into the store for _name_. The user is prompted to
enter a password on standard input. This command is alternatively named
*add*.

*rm* _name_::

Remove a password from the store. This command is alternatively named
*remove*.

*edit* _name_::

Modify an existing item in the password store. The user is prompted to
enter a password on standard input.

*pubkey*::

Display the public key for the password store's secret key.
